        <h2>About Enttoi</h2>
        <p>Enttoi is a system that collects real-time events that sent out from hardware sensors. This data then normalized 
            and displayed in different shapes on different clients.</p>

        <p>Although it seems like a simple task, or as many tend to say two lines of code ;), there are in fact many moving
            parts. The good news are that the entire project was built with <cite>open source</cite> in mind, thus anyone
            can see the <a href="https://github.com/Enttoi" target="_blank">implementation details</a> or even <a href="http://enttoi.github.io/"
            target="_blank">high level overview</a>.
        </p>

        <p>We'll be happy to accept any contribution:
            <ul>
