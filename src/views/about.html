    <h2>About Enttoi</h2>
    <p>Enttoi is a system that collects real-time events that sent out from hardware sensors. This data then normalized and
      displayed in different shapes on different clients.</p>

    <p>Although it seems like a simple task, or as many tend to say two lines of code ;), there are in fact many moving parts.
      The good news are that the entire project was built with <cite>open source</cite> in mind, thus anyone can check out
      the
      <a href="http://enttoi.github.io/" target="_blank">high level overview</a> and, obviously, <a href="https://github.com/Enttoi"
      target="_blank">implementation details</a>.
